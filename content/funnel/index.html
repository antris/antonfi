<h1 class="h1">How to make a funnel in Google Analytics</h1>

<p>February 27, 2015</p>

<p>So you know what a funnel is, but don’t know how to do it GA? I’ll show you the simplest possible funnel you can make!</p>

<a class="imageAsLink" href="funnel_example.png">Click here to view an example of a funnel</a>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Sign up and set up</a> Google Analytics on your site.</li>
<li>Make sure that for each step that you want in your funnel, you are sending a “page view” to Google Analytics. If you have a single-page app where the URL doesn’t change for each step, you can do this with the following JavaScript code: <code>ga('send', 'pageview', &lt;PAGE URL&gt;, &lt;PAGE TITLE&gt;)</code>. For example <code>ga('send', '/viewedProduct', 'Viewed product')</code>. If your Google Analytics tracking code is set up for your whole site and you do a full page refresh on each step, you don’t need to edit the code at all. The title doesn’t really matter, but remember what the page URLs are. They will be needed later when you define the steps for the funnel.</page></page></li>
<li>Sign in to Google analytics and find the site (or “Property” in Google Analytics lingo) that you want to set up the funnel for.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Admin</strong> tab on top.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Goals</strong> on right.</li>
<li>Click the red <strong>+ NEW GOAL</strong> on top.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> field, you can put whatever you want. Usually it’s best to put a description of the “last step” in there. For example “Paid for purchase”. As for "Goal slot ID", I have no idea what it is. Leave it be.</li>
<li>For <strong>Type</strong>, select <strong>Destination</strong> and press <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Goal details</strong> section, for <strong>Destination</strong> put the URL that you sent to GA in step 2. This is the <em>final step</em> of the funnel.</li>
<li>Keep "Value" off. You can set it up later.</li>
<li>Put <strong>Funnel</strong> on!</li>
<li>Now you'll set up the steps <em>leading to</em> the final step. For each step of the funnel, name the step descriptively, basically what the user did.</li>
<li>Also, for each step put the URL exactly as you sent it to GA in step 2. Keep the "Required" switch in "No". I don’t know why it’s there.</li>
<li>Press <strong>CREATE GOAL</strong></li>
<li>Deploy your code and wait for the results to come in!</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="h2">Viewing your report</h2>
<ol>
<li>When you think you have some results, go again to Google Analytics and find your site. This time, instead of the "Admin" tab, choose the <strong>Reporting</strong> tab on top of the site.</li>
<li>In the top left search bar, type <strong>funnel</strong> and select <strong>Conversions &gt; Goals &gt; Funnel visualisation</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Goal option</strong> drop down, make sure you have selected the Goal that you just set up.</li>
<li>Scroll down.</li>
<li>There it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>If see your data for today, remember to put today in the selected date range (on top left). The data will show up with some delay.</p>
