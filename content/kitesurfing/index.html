<h1>What's kitesurfing?</h1>

<p>
    Kitesurfing is a fun sport that allows you to surf on water harnessing the
    power of wind. It can be done on wavy waters, but waves are not required,
    since the propelling power comes from the kite rather than the waves. Most
    kitesurfers prefer a "flat", non-wavy environment with a strong wind. Flat
    water allows for an easy environment to land tricks, and a strong wind
    allows the use of smaller kites that are quicker to control.

    Surfing can be done anywhere where there is a coast and a constant wind.
    Spotty wind makes kites harder to control. Thanks to modern wetsuits, water
    temperature is never a problem. When strong enough ice is formed on the
    water, you can kitesurf using a snowboard. Some people use kites to climb
    and jump on hills. Although surfing makes you instantly think of a sunny, 
    hot beach and palm trees, Finland is actually a rather good place for
    kitesurfing. There's lots of coast and lots of wind throughout the year.
